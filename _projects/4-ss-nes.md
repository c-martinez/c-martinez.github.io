I was the project lead of the [Best Practices for Sustainable Software](https://tdcc.nl/projects/project-initiatives-nes/tdcc-nes-bottleneck-projects/best-practices-for-sustainable-software/) project.
This project, which was funded by  [The Thematic Digital Competence Centre (TDCC) for the Natural & Engineering Sciences (NES)](https://tdcc.nl/about-tddc/nes/)

In this project we created guidance, tools, and training materials for developing software in a sustainable way. We also improved integration between [4TU.Research Data repository](https://data.4tu.nl/) and the [Research Software Directory](https://research-software-directory.org/)

Project outputs are listed in the [project GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SS-NES).
