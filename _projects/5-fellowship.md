Together with my colleague [Lieke de Boer](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/team/lieke-de-boer/), we were running the [eScience center Fellowship Programme](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/fellowship-programme/) since its creation in 2022.

The eScience Fellowship Programme is aimed at members of the academic research community, working in the Netherlands, who are passionate to act as ambassadors for the use (and reuse) of research software. Research software can be any piece of code, script, package, tool, library, or programme written for the purpose of being used in research.
