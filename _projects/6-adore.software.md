I have been involved in the creation of the Amsterdam Declaration on Funding Research Software Sustainability([ADORE.software](https://adore.software/)).
I was part of the organising team and participant durint the [International funders workshop](https://adore.software/2023/03/international-funders-workshop-the-future-of-research-software/) in 2022, and have supported the drafting of the [first version of the declaration](https://zenodo.org/records/8325436) and the [first update]( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13735888).
