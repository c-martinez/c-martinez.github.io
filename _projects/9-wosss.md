Workshop on Sustainable Software Sustainability ([WoSSS](https://wosss.org/)), was a series of international workshops on the topic of software sustainability; it has a particular focus on bringing together different research communities and provisions for the long term.

The series of workshops ran between 2015 and 2021, with reports being produced for each workshop. I was involved in the organisation from 2017 onwards.
