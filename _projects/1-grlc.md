[grlc](https://github.com/CLARIAH/grlc) (pronounced garlic) is an open source tool which I started using in [one of my projects](https://research-software-directory.org/projects/dive), and continued contributing to it in my own time. You can find out more about where it is used [here](https://research-software-directory.org/software/grlc).
